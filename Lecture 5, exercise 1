13.2.1 Exercise

1a. What variables would you need?
 You will need the flight, origin, destination, and tailnum variable.

1b. What tables would you need to combine?
  You will need the airports and plane variable. 

2. The relationship between weather and airport is the origin. It can be 
appeared on the diagram by drawing drawing and arrow from the airport faa 
to origin and then to weather.

3. what additional relation would it define with flights?
  It give you information about the arrivals.

##1
Avg_delay_dest <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa" )) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(color = avg_delay,lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()  
  
Avg_delay_dest


##2 Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon)
#to flights.

flights_with_origin <- flights %>% select(year:day,hour, origin, dest) %>%  
  left_join(select(airports,"faa","lat","lon"), by = c("origin" = "faa")) 
  left_join(select(airports, "faa","lat","lon"), by = c("dest" = "faa"))

##3
Yes

##2. 
Planesless100 <- flights %>% group_by(tailnum)%>%
  summarize(flight_count = n()) %>%  filter(flight_count<=100) %>% 
  semi_join(Planesless100, by = "tailnum")
  
##5.

anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
# This shows all flights outside of the US
anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))
# This shows all US airports that were not listed under "dest" in the flight table
